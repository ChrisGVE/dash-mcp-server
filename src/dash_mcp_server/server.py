# and 54 searches over 18 queries against 198 installed docsets, 12k-93k characters each),
# then validated on a held-out third against six tokenizers: GPT-4o (o200k), GPT-4
# (cl100k), Qwen3, DeepSeek-V3, Kimi-K2 and GLM-4.5.
#
# Letters and symbols are counted separately because they cost very different amounts. A
# response of this kind is roughly 63% letters, 25% punctuation and URL syntax, 7% digits
# and only 5% spaces; JSON punctuation costs about one token per character, while letters
# pack around eight per token in identifier-dense text. A single chars-per-token divisor
# has to average across that ratio, and because the ratio swings with the shape of the
# payload no single value fits: 4 characters per token reports 12-43% low across the
# held-out set, so the documented cap never bites. Counting the two classes separately
# tracks the real count to within 0-24%.
#
# The coefficients include a 1.14 safety factor, so the estimate never falls below the true
# count for any of the six. That asymmetry is deliberate: this figure guards a truncation
# cap, where over-estimating returns slightly less content than it could, but
# under-estimating overruns the caller's context window.
#
# Scope, stated plainly: the fit is calibrated on this server's search and docset responses.

# and would be under-estimated by up to 11%. Prose-heavy text — a converted documentation
# page, which no caller of this function currently produces — has a different letter/space
# mix, and these coefficients land anywhere between 25% under and 29% over on it (measured
# on 80 real pages loaded through this server). Text of that shape needs its own
